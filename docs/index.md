# Quest
A bunch of ass holes have been sent out into [[The Sands]] by Grand Magister [[Rithra Iscalion]] who is one of [[The Timeless Ones]] a group of people who made themselves immortal by harnessing the power of [[Obelisks]] and hiding them away in [[Vaults]].

The Obelisks where originally created by the [[Fahl]] who used them to hide the world from the evil of [[The Dark Star]] but the Timeless ones broke this when they used the powers to immortalise themselves. From the ritual they performed the dark star has started to creep into the world via the obelisks and they must now be destroyed.

The party has currently destroyed the obelisk in both the [[Vault of Varanis Witt]] & [[Vault of Ishanna Ophi]] and are now heading to do the same in the [[Vault of Ataish]]
