We headed through the sands and bumped into the real sand snakes smashing up a large crystal trying to enslave whatever is inside, as we approached they clear off and we solved the puzzle to unlock the crystal that released Tamrin (AKA Alex) 

We then went to camp up where we where attacked by a undead human man who's flesh was dry and leathery and his eyes where pale white
Following the man was 2 2-headed undead dogs.
