Gorag is a police constable. we met him on the quest from the [[Mysterious note]] who suggested we look in [[Wonderus Bazzarr]] or [[Drunken Afriti]] for our next clue.

He is a cockney man who loves jellied eels.
He killed his own brother because they where in love with the same woman.
He also lost a loved one but didn't go into much detail as we left

He used to call his axe Elsie however he has never danced with a woman called Elsie
