Miek transformed into [[Yorelum Goldanlance]] in the [[Library of the 12th star]]

In the [[Vault of Ishanna Ophi]] Miek sorta kinda maybe died? and woke up saying the name of [[Rascaetha]]

Miek has a 2nd persona Jason, where he morphs into the shape of [[People/Party/Grenvalk]] but with baggy clothes
