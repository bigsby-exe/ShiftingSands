The burial ground of [[Tatu Village]] was defiled by [[Ihieslah]] in an effort to resurrect [[Sseth]]

In the ground we also found the coffins of [[Reqor Iscalion]] next to an empty unmarked sarcophagus.
When holding out [[The key]] it shows a hidden message of "A place for me where ill never be turn and flee or use they key". [[Grenvalk]] was closed in the coffin with the key in his mouth, inside the lid was a message that read "the door lies beyond the grave"
We dragged the coffin away from the wall and found a keyhole, using they key we opened a doorway
