Entering the vault we entered behind an unmarked tomb next to the tomb of [[Reqor Iscalion]]
There where 4 challenges inside inside vault:

## Elemental Challenges 
## üî• Fire
the phrase brave the flames was written in rocks and when said by [[Grenvalk]] a big bad fire worm fuck appeared creating fiery orbs we needed to use to  light some braziers 

## üíß Water
A twilight room with a moon in the sky above, there was a stone platform along the side walls and a large pool of water 15 ft below the platform 
There is a large waterfall in the south west
north wall has 3 shallow pools 
north east has a jug on a table 
south west large pipe and cogs and water wheel system.

There was a water creature who was guarding a cog at the top of the waterfall, the cog looks like it would fit in the machinery on the south west wall.
In the small pools the party members who looked into them got TPed into a under water cage and a weird angry shadow was left in there place to fight the party.

[[Gosha]] was turned into a giant shark by [[Roman Eagletree]] and then beast sense controlled by the aquatic beast master [[Eugene Stormwindler]] beast who then used the shark to free him from his cage and LAUNCH him up the waterfall... it worked (checks notes again) it worked.

[[Grenvalk]] filled and then emptied and stole some jug of trolling and then bullied [[Burbleass]] into flying out to get the jug on the bases if he didn't we would never use him for his purpose of being a key
[[Burbleass]] Flew over but [[Eugene Stormwindler]] beat him to the wheel and from that we got the gem

## üçÉ Air
4 floating diamonds in the sky spun real fast so we cracked it open and our of it came a tempest 
zephyrs appeared in the room 

## üå±Earth
A large underground room with sinking mud.

We found 3 stone tablets that had riddles on them when we read them out with an answer they crumbled into sand apart from the last one that release a gem stone for us.

1. I have roots nobody sees taller than trees up up I go yet I never grow what am I? - Mountain 
2. Taken from a mine and shut in a case from far away I am viewed with awe but closer I am just ordinary rock what am I? - Diamond 
3. I walk in the wind but stand when wet, I count time and stop clocks, I swallow kingdoms and gnaw rocks what am I - Sand
4. I bring smoke and ash but I am not a fire, I throw rocks but I am not a catapult what am I - Volcano 


## Post challenges 
After the challenges we where lowered down on the platform to see more elemental areas.
In each of the querents we saw 4 objects
1. a metal and stone hart 
2. a crystal clear sparkling water tear drop
3. gem of storm and lightning 
4. orb of fire and magma 
[[Rithra Iscalion]] piped up again and told us we where going to fight her
it turns out it wasn't really her it was [[Rithra Iscalion Simulacrum]]

After defeating the simulacrum we spoke with the [[Elementals]] that got fuckin huge the told us how the [[Obelisks]] was corrupt by [[The Dark Star]] that also corrupt [[Rithra Iscalion Simulacrum]] & then imprisoned the elementals and used there power against them.
The lads decided that now they where free they would stop the sands shifting 

The lads ([[Elementals]]) gave [[Miek]] the [[Sand Fury Twin Blades]]
