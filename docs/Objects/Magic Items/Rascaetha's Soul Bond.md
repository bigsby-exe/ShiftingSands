The corrupted essence of [[Rascaetha]] has bonded with your soul, returning your body to life.

The bond with Rascaetha alters the fabric of your soul. Whilst bonded you are only able to attune to two magic items. You do not believe that this bond cannot be ended, even in death.

You may invoke the power of the soul bond to use the following features a total of 4 times. After the 4th time you cannot invoke the soul bond again until you complete a long rest.

_**Guided Hands -**_ when making an ability check, you may choose to do so with advantage. Once you have used this feature, you cannot do so again until you have completed a long rest.

_**Unfaltering -**_ when you or a creature you can see within 60 feet is reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you may spend your reaction to for them to drop to 1 hit point instead. Once you have used this feature, you cannot do so again until you have completed a long rest.

_**Harnessed Pain -**_ when you take damage from a source other than a hostile creature, you can choose to gain 1 charge of Harnessed Pain. You may only have 1 charge of Harnessed Pain at a time and it lasts until expended or you complete a short or long rest. When you hit with a weapon attack, you may expend a charge of Harnessed Pain to deal an additional **d6**![](chrome-extension://gnblbpbepfbfmoobegdogkglpbhcjofh/images/icons/badges/custom20.png) of the weapon's damage type. (A hostile creature is any creature that has made an attack roll, cast a spell or otherwise acted with the intention of harming you).

_**Dark Vigour-**_ on your turn, you may use your bonus action to touch a creature and roll 1 of your hit dice. The creature restores hit points equal to the amount rolled + your Constitution modifier. Using this feature does not count against your number of available hit dice.
