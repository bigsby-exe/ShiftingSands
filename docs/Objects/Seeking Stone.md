___
A palm-sized obsidian stone inscribed with a series of glyphs and runes. Its surface is smooth and cold to the touch whilst the edges of the stone are dangerously sharp.

Any creature with a Seeking Stone in their possession can magically sense the current direction to the [[Vault of Varanis Witt]] as long as they and the vault are on the same plane of existence. They are not aware of the vault's exact location or the distance between themselves and the vault.

Created byÂ [[Rithra Iscalion]] Magister of Beszo to aid adventurers in locating the lost vaults created by The Timeless Ones, a group of ageless mages that once ruled the desert province of Alm.

Currently being held by [[Grenvalk]] to locate the [[Vault of Varanis Witt]]

Pretty sure Grenvalk threw it at a snake or some shit
