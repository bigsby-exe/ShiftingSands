5-a-side black jack is a game created by [[The Save Snakes]] whereby 7 cards are dealt in a circle in the centre of the table.
Each player picks one card from the centre and combines it with a card from the deck (without looking at the card from the deck first).
Players then flip there cards and see if the value is equal to or close to 21
