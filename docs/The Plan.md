After visiting the [[Vault of Varanis Witt]] we came up with The Plan.
This is a swindle to trick [[Varanis Witt]] into believing we have destroyed the [[Vault of Rithra Iscalion]] when in actual fact we plan to enter the vault, fake the destruction then take back an artifact to Varanis.

# Step 1 
Enter the [[Vault of Rithra Iscalion]] and find something to "prove" it's destroyed

# Step 2 
Take [[The Artifact]] to [[Varanis Witt]] and prove to him it's safe to destroy his own vault 

# Step 3 
Convince Varanis we will destroy his vault for him 

# Step 4 
Go back and destroy the [[Vault of Rithra Iscalion]] frfr 

# Step 5 
???

# Step 6
Profit
